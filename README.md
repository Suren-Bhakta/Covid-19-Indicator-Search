# Rstudio
This repository shows the culmination of skills I have learned in the statistical coding software Rstudio. Within Rstudio, I created a two-part project that showcases the skills I have in the software. Skills and techniques include, data wrangling with dplyr functions filter, select, arrange, group_by, mutate, and summarize. Also performed were data cleaning, tidying, and the generation of six different graphs based on the current data. Within project two, there were more skills implemented such as exploratory data analysis, data clustering, principal component analysis, along with classification and cross-validation where we trained and tested a logistic regression line for performance across 10 k-folds.

A personal project was completed focusing on the topic of Covid-19 and determining if metrics of certain countries were indicators of the virus in hopes of displaying ideas of how to prevent a future outbreak.
